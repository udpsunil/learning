<h2 style="text-align: center;">Description</h2>

<p>Let's compute all the parameters of the credit. There are at least two kinds of credit loans: those with annuity payment and those with differentiated payment. At this stage, you're going to calculate only the annuity payment that is fixed during the whole credit term.</p>

<p>Here is the formula:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span class="math-tex">\(A_{ordinary\_annuity} = P * \dfrac{i * (1+i)^n}{(1+i)^n-1}\)</span></p>

<p>Where:</p>

<p><span class="math-tex">\(A\)</span> = annuity payment</p>

<p><span class="math-tex">\(P\)</span> = Credit principal.</p>

<p><span class="math-tex">\(i\)</span> = nominal (monthly) interest rate. Usually, it’s 1/12 of the annual interest rate, and usually, it’s a floating value, not a percentage. For example, if you have annual interest rate = 12%, then i = 0.01.</p>

<p><span class="math-tex">\(n\)</span> = Number of payments. Usually, it’s the number of months.</p>

<p>You are interested in four values: the number of periods to repay the credit loan, the monthly payment, credit principal, and credit interest. Each of these values can be calculated if the others are known:</p>

<p><strong>Credit principal:</strong></p>

<p><span class="math-tex">\(P = \dfrac{A}{\left( \dfrac{i * (1+i)^n}{(1+i)^n-1} \right)}\)</span></p>

<p><strong>A number of payments:</strong></p>

<p><strong><span class="math-tex">\(n = \log_{1+i} \left( \dfrac{A}{A - i*P} \right)\)</span></strong></p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Objectives</h2>

<p>At this stage, you should add new functionality to your calculator:</p>

<ol>
	<li>First, prompt the user for the parameter they want to calculate. The calculator should be able to calculate the number of periods, the amount of monthly payment, and credit principal.</li>
	<li>Then, prompt them to input the remaining values.</li>
	<li>Finally, compute and output the value that they wanted.</li>
</ol>

<p><div class="alert alert-warning">Note that the interest rate is input as a percentage, for example, 11.7, so you should divide this value by 100 to use it in the formula above.</div></p>

<p>Please be accurate when converting "<strong>X months</strong>" to "<strong>Y years and Z months</strong>". Avoid writing "<span style="color: #ff4363;">0 years and 11 months</span>" (output "<span style="color: #66cc66;">11 months</span>" instead) and "<span style="color: #ff4363;">1 years and 0 months</span>" (output "<span style="color: #66cc66;">1 year</span>" instead).</p>

<p>Note that at this stage you have to ask the user to input the parameters in a determined order provided below. Simply disregard the value that the user wants to calculate and follow the rest of the order. For example, it can be the monthly payment if the user typed “a” for the question “What do you want to calculate?”. Here is the order:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>The first is the credit principal. </p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The second is a monthly payment. </p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The next is the count of the period.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The last is the credit interest.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Examples</h2>

<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.</p>

<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">What do you want to calculate? 
type "n" for the count of months, 
type "a" for the annuity monthly payment,
type "p" for credit principal: 
&gt; n
Enter credit principal: 
&gt; 1000000
Enter monthly payment: 
&gt; 15000
Enter credit interest:
&gt; 10
You need 8 years and 2 months to repay this credit!</code></pre>

<p>Let’s take a closer look at <strong>Example 1</strong>.</p>

<p>You know the credit principal and the credit interest, and you want to calculate the count of months. What should you do?</p>

<p>1) You need to know the nominal interest rate. It is calculated like this:</p>

<p><span class="math-tex">\(i = \dfrac{10\%}{12 * 100\%} = 0.008333...\)</span></p>

<p>2) Now you can calculate the count of periods:</p>

<p><span class="math-tex">\(n = \log_{1 + 0.008333...} \left( \dfrac{15000}{15000-0.008333... * 1000000} \right) = 97.71...\)</span></p>

<p>3) You need an integer number, so let’s round it up. Notice that the user will pay a monthly payment for 97 months, and for 98th month the user will pay 0.71... of the monthly payment. So, there are 98 months to pay.</p>

<p><span class="math-tex">\(n = 98\)</span></p>

<p>4) Finally, you need to convert “98 months” to “8 years and 2 months”, so it is more readable and understandable for the user.</p>
