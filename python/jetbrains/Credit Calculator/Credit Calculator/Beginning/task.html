<h2 style="text-align: center;">Description</h2>

<p>Let's think: what should a basic credit calculator be able to do? In general, it is supposed to take several parameters such as credit principal and credit interest, calculate the needed values (for example, monthly payment or overpayment), and output them.</p>

<p>If you are not familiar with these financial concepts, don't worry: we can explain them to you in simple terms. The principal is the original amount of money you get on a credit. The interest is the charge you pay for borrowing money, usually calculated as a percentage of the loan sum.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Objective</h2>

<p>Let's start by imitating this basic behavior. There are some prepared variables in the source code that are ready for use: these are the text messages that our credit calculator could output. At this stage, all you need to do is output them in the right order.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Example</h2>

<p>Output:</p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Credit principal: 1000
Month 1: paid out 250
Month 2: paid out 250
Month 3: paid out 500
The credit has been repaid!</code></pre>
